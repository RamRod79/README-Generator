# README-Generator

## Description

A short description explaining the what, why, and how of project "README-Generator":

This application will help a user produce a high-quality README for their app. It will include various informaiton to include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributionsâ€”this last part increases the likelihood that other developers will contribute to the success of the project.

It quickly and easily generates a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time working on the project.

It creates a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package (Links to an external site.).
